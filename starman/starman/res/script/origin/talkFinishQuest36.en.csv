1,One month later.,,,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
2,A month had passed since they decided to build a boat.,,,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
3,"Star Man gathered food and boat materials,
while Trapezoid Man and the others worked on building the boat.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
4,"Star Man's fire magic lacked heat and staying power,
so he couldn't smelt the copper ore.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
5,"The four gathered in Trapezoid Man's room.
In front of him was a boat about 30 centimeters long.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
6,"""Star Man. I still can't fill the gaps.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
7,"Trapezoid Man said to Star Man.
The boat, made of cords and branches, was riddled with gaps.
They had no nails, no saw, and no adhesive.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
8,The four searched for a way to fill the gaps.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
9,"""So, while I was making this, I had an idea:
Instead of a boat, why don't we make a raft?
With a raft, we can just lash logs together with cords.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
10,Trapezoid Man produced a raft model from behind his back.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
11,"""Ta‑da.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
12,said Triangle Man.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
13,"The raft was about 30 centimeters long, made of branches and cords.
Four plate‑like layers of branches lashed into panels were stacked alternately
lengthwise and crosswise. Nuts were tied all around the edges.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
14,"""We don't have a saw, but if we make a stone axe, we could probably fell trees up to 10 cm.
Just that alone might sink quickly, so the plan is to layer them like this.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
15,"""By stacking lengthwise and crosswise alternately,
it will be less likely to deform when someone gets on.""",,,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
16,"""I see.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
17,"""Amazing... I'm impressed...""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
18,Star Man was moved by Trapezoid Man's work.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
19,"""At this rate, it looks like it could last ten days without breaking.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
20,"It was 100 km to the opposite shore.
No one really knew what a 100‑km voyage entailed, but—",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
21,"Assuming they could reach it in ten days,
they set a provisional goal of ""lasting ten days without breaking.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
22,"""Understood. Let's switch to building a raft.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
23,The four decided to start making a raft.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,res\\image\\talkPrecision.png
