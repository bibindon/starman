9,Trapezoid Man said.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
10,"""The kids started calling the ones that attack 'VSCO'
and the ones that don’t 'Vim.'
I don’t really know who the originals are, though.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,

they usually pick words that would annoy the person being nicknamed.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,

15,"Before long, they began calling the aggressive ones 'VSCO'
and the peaceful ones 'Vim.'",,,,
16,"Since that day, VSCO hadn’t shown up again.
Star Man and the others kept working on building their boat.",,,,
17,"""It’s been a while now—how’s your leg doing?""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
18,Star Man asked Trapezoid Man.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
19,"""Sorry. I think it’s no good anymore.
Both legs were badly broken—compound fractures.
They would’ve needed surgery. Now they’re all messed up.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
20,"In reality, Trapezoid Man’s injuries weren’t just compound fractures—
his legs had been shattered into tiny pieces.",,,,
21,"Since shattered bones don’t heal on their own, they were left as-is,
and he developed 'pseudo-joints'—false joints formed from improper healing.",,,,
22,"He had multiple pseudo-joints in his ankles and heels,
and could no longer support his own weight.",,,,
23,"""At first, the pain was so bad I nearly blacked out every second...
But now, as long as I don’t touch them, it’s okay.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
24,"""…That’s good to hear.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,

26,"Star Man, Triangle Man, and Rectangle Man floated the raft in the river.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
27,"""Alright…""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,

It held his weight without sinking.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
29,"""Yay!!""",res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,,
30,"Trapezoid Man shouted, throwing both arms up in a victory pose.",res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,,
31,Star Man and the others had built two rafts.,,,,
32,"The first one they made fell apart within an hour after Star Man boarded it—
the ropes came loose and it collapsed.",,,,
33,"None of them knew how to tie proper knots,
so they had just wrapped the rope around a lot of times.",,,,
34,"The second raft they made didn’t fall apart,
but it slowly sank and was fully submerged after five hours.",,,,
35,"""Sinking after five hours isn’t going to cut it...
We just used whatever wood was lying around the house,
but maybe we should try different kinds.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
36,———,,,,
37,"After that, Star Man and the others spent several days
gathering various types of wood and testing which ones floated better.",,,,
38,"(After about three days, they all start to sink.
Is it even possible to make a raft that doesn’t sink?
Maybe we just need one that floats long enough to reach the next island.)",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
39,"During the raft-building process, Star Man and the others managed to make a stone axe.
It let them gather wood, but it took six hours to cut through a log 5 cm in diameter,
and after two days, the stone and wood joint tore apart, making it unusable.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
40,Star Man and the others kept improving it little by little through trial and error.,,,,
