1,res\\image\\dream01.png,Star Man was watching TV in his childhood bedroom at his parents' house.
1,,"He thought he was watching alone, but when he glanced beside him, a woman was sitting there—someone Star Man knew well."
1,,"She was also staring at the TV. Her face was hard to make out, but Star Man felt relieved and spoke to her."
1,,"""Ah... thank goodness. We were planning to go to Optiple Island.
 The boat sank and ruined everything, but the tickets were refunded so we can try again."""
2,res\\image\\dream02.png,"""...Eh? Yeah..."""
2,,Her reply was vague.
2,,"""Wasn't there supposed to be a typhoon...?"""
3,res\\image\\dream03.png,"""Oh... that's right, another typhoon.
 Well... I guess we'll have to give up on going this weekend..."""
3,,(...When will we ever be able to go...?)
3,,"""Please board the ship."""
3,,A sudden announcement echoed through the room.
3,,(I have to go...)
3,,"When Star Man stood up, he found he was alone in the room."
3,,"(Damn it.
 Diamond Man went on ahead.
 Crap... my leg's injured... I have to hurry or I'll miss the boat...)"
3,,"His legs wouldn't cooperate and he could barely move forward.
Star Man tried to shout toward the announcement, ""I'm coming, please wait!"" but no sound came out."
