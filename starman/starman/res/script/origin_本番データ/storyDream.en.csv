1,res\\image\\dream01.png,Star Man was watching TV in his room at his parents' house.
1,,"He thought he was watching TV alone, but when he looked beside him, a woman was sitting there.
It was a woman Star Man knew well."
1,,"The woman was also looking toward the TV.
He couldn't see her face clearly. Relieved, Star Man spoke to her."
1,,"""Ah... good. I was going to go to Optiple Island.
The ship sank, so it didn't work out,
but the ticket got refunded and reissued, so I can go again."""
2,res\\image\\dream02.png,"""...Huh? Yeah..."""
2,,Her answer was vague.
2,,"""Wasn't there a typhoon...?"""
3,res\\image\\dream03.png,"""Ah... it's another typhoon, right.
Then... I guess I'll give up on going this weekend..."""
3,,(...When will I be able to go...?)
3,,"""Please board the ship."""
3,,"Suddenly, an announcement played."
3,,(I have to go...)
3,,"When Star Man stood up, he was the only one in the room."
3,,"(Damn.
Diamond Woman has already gone ahead.
Damn... my leg was injured... If I don't hurry, I'll miss it...)"
3,,"His legs wouldn't move the way he wanted, and he could barely make any progress.
Star Man tried to say toward the announcement, ""I'm coming, so wait for me.""
But there was no strength in his jaw or tongue, and he couldn't get the words out properly."
