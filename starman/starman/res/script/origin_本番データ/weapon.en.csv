w1,Stone,"Throw or bash with it—it's crazy strong.
No matter how much you use it, it never
breaks.",res\\model\\rock1.x,res\\image\\stone.png,0.5,500,0,3.0,0.0,30,0,10,999,0,10
w2,Wooden Stick,"Breaks after about three swings; far
weaker than punching.
A twig won't hurt a person much, but a
wooden bat can be fatal.
Keep crafting and you'll manage a
respectable bat‑like club.

Can be upgraded from +1 to +5.",res\\model\\stick.x,res\\image\\stick.png,1.0,2000,5,0.2,0.3,10,0,10,3,10,10
w3,Stone Spear,"Breaks after roughly three thrusts; far
weaker than punching.
A beginner's first stone spear hits like
zero damage, but spares your hand
injuries.
Craft it repeatedly and it becomes
usable.
Some people have even bested a lion with
one.

Can be upgraded from +1 to +5.",res\\model\\spear.x,res\\image\\spear2.png,1.0,2000,5,0.2,0.3,10,0,10,3,10,10
w4,Bow,"Homemade bow, breaks after around ten
shots.
A beginner's first bow barely flies five
meters and does virtually no damage.
Keep making new ones and they'll become
serviceable.

Can be upgraded from +1 to +10.
Throwing the bow still travels the same
distance.",res\\model\\bow.x,res\\image\\bow.png,1.0,3000,10,0.1,0.1,3,1,10,10,1,10
w5,Iron Pipe,"Hard to break but deals modest damage;
at least your hands stay safe.",res\\model\\ironPipe.x,res\\image\\pipe.png,1.0,2000,0,1.0,0.0,20,0,10,999,0,10
w6,Stone‑Tipped Iron Pipe,"An iron pipe with a stone strapped to
its tip.",res\\model\\ironPipeEx.x,res\\image\\ironPipe.png,2.0,3000,0,4.0,0.0,15,0,10,10,0,10
w7,Stone Axe,"A branch with a stone tied on; the
binding is fragile and breaks quickly.
Recraft it often and you'll fashion
sturdier versions.
After several tries you'll realize
sharpening the stone tip is crucial.

Can be upgraded from +1 to +5.",res\\model\\ax.x,res\\image\\ax.png,1.5,2000,5,4.0,0.0,20,0,10,30,10,10
w8,Arrow,"Arrows are a pain to make.
Spent arrows can be picked up and
reused.",res\\model\\arrow.x,res\\image\\arrow.png,0.2,500,1,2.0,0.0,40,1,5,10,1,5
w9,Atlatl,"Not 'astral'—it's an atlatl.
Starman once saw one on a video site.
An average person would end up with
brutal muscle aches after using it.",res\\model\\atlatl.x,res\\image\\atlatl.png,0.4,500,0,1.0,0.0,10,0,10,999,0,10
w10,Atlatl Dart,"If the shaft isn't a flexible springy
material, it won't fly at all.
You'll figure that out after a few
throws.

Can be upgraded from +1 to +5.",res\\model\\arrow.x,res\\image\\arrow.png,0.6,2000,5,2.0,0.0,40,0,5,10,10,5
w11,Torch,"While holding a stick you can craft a
torch from the action menu.
With a torch equipped you can choose
'Light Torch'.
It breaks after a single attack.
If it's lit you can also 'Extinguish
Torch'.

To unequip it, you must extinguish the
flame.
You can also ditch it by throwing the
torch.",res\\model\\\torch.x,res\\image\\torch2.png,1.0,2000,0,0.2,0.0,10,0,10,300,0,10
