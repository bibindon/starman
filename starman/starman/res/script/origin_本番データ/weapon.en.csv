w1,石,"Can be thrown or used as a club.
Ridiculously strong. Never breaks, no
matter how many times you use it.",res\\model\\rock1.x,res\\image\\stone.png,0.5,500,0,3.0,0.0,30,0,10,999,0,10
w2,木の棒,"Breaks after roughly three swings and is
far weaker than bare fists. A person
struck with a thin branch takes little
damage, but a solid wooden bat can be
fatal. If you keep crafting you'll
eventually be able to make a proper
bat‑like weapon.  Can be upgraded from
+1 to +5.",res\\model\\stick.x,res\\image\\stick.png,1.0,2000,5,0.2,0.3,10,0,10,3,10,10
w3,石槍,"Breaks after about three thrusts and is
much weaker than punches. A beginner’s
first stone spear has virtually zero
attack power, but at least you won’t cut
your hands. By making them repeatedly
you’ll craft a spear that’s actually
usable. Some people have even taken down
lions with one.  Can be upgraded from +1
to +5.",res\\model\\spear.x,res\\image\\spear2.png,1.0,2000,5,0.2,0.3,10,0,10,3,10,10
w4,弓矢の弓,"Homemade bow and arrows; the bow breaks
after roughly ten shots. A novice’s
first bow only shoots about five metres
and its attack power is almost zero.
Repeated crafting will turn it into a
serviceable weapon.  Can be upgraded
from +1 to +10. The distance the bow
itself flies when thrown does not
change.",res\\model\\bow.x,res\\image\\bow.png,1.0,3000,10,0.1,0.1,3,1,10,10,1,10
w5,鉄パイプ,"Hard to break but can’t deal significant
damage. On the upside, it saves your
hands from injury.",res\\model\\ironPipe.x,res\\image\\pipe.png,1.0,2000,0,1.0,0.0,20,0,10,999,0,10

to the tip.",res\\model\\ironPipeEx.x,res\\image\\ironPipe.png,2.0,3000,0,4.0,0.0,15,0,10,10,0,10
w7,石斧,"A stone lashed to a branch; the bindings
are fragile so it breaks quickly. By
making it over and over you’ll learn to
craft a more durable axe. After several
attempts you’ll realise that sharpening
the stone edge is the key.  Can be
upgraded from +1 to +5.",res\\model\\ax.x,res\\image\\ax.png,1.5,2000,5,4.0,0.0,20,0,10,30,10,10
w8,弓矢の矢,"Arrows are very labour‑intensive to
craft. Any arrow you fire can be picked
up and reused.",res\\model\\arrow.x,res\\image\\arrow.png,0.2,500,1,2.0,0.0,40,1,5,10,1,5
w9,アトラトル,"It’s an atlatl, not “astral”. Star Man
once saw an atlatl on a video‑sharing
site. An ordinary person would probably
suffer crippling muscle pain after using
it.",res\\model\\atlatl.x,res\\image\\atlatl.png,0.4,500,0,1.0,0.0,10,0,10,999,0,10
w10,アトラトルに使う槍,"If the shaft isn’t made of a flexible,
springy material it actually doesn’t fly
at all. You’ll notice that only after
using it many times.  Can be upgraded
from +1 to +5.",res\\model\\arrow.x,res\\image\\arrow.png,0.6,2000,5,2.0,0.0,40,0,5,10,10,5
w11,松明,"When you have a wooden stick equipped
you can craft a torch from the action
menu. While holding a torch you can
choose “Light the torch”. It breaks the
first time you use it as a weapon. If
it’s lit you can choose “Extinguish the
torch”.  You must extinguish the flame
to unequip the torch, though you can
also throw it away to remove it.",res\\model\\\torch.x,res\\image\\torch2.png,1.0,2000,0,0.2,0.0,10,0,10,300,0,10
