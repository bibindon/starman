1,Star Man looked ahead and saw a cylindrical object approaching him.,res\\image\\enchuu00.png,,,
2,"(Oh no. That’s a monster too, isn’t it?)",res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
3,"Since the monsters usually remain completely still, they’re hard to spot. You only notice them once they start moving.",res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
4,(This time it’s shaped like a cylinder...),res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,

6,(Should I try fighting it...?),res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
7,Star Man readied his stone spear.,res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
8,"For the past week, Star Man had been living on the run from monsters.
Among them, he especially had to dodge projectiles thrown by disc-shaped enemies,

11,The cylindrical monster charged like a bull.,res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
12,Star Man jumped to the side to dodge. Dirt and leaves scattered around him.,res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
13,The cylindrical monster turned toward him and slowly began to approach.,res\\image\\enchuu00.png,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
14,"(I dodged it earlier because there was distance...
But if it charges from that close, I probably can’t avoid it.
If I get stepped on, I might die instantly...)",,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
15,"Like the other monsters, this cylindrical one also seemed to weigh several hundred kilos.",res\\image\\enchuu00.png,,,
16,(I should run.),,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
17,"Star Man ran off at a trot.
Even if he defeated a monster, he couldn’t eat it or get any materials from it.
So unless it was a frequently used or unavoidable path, he usually chose to flee.",,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,
18,"After walking for a while, he came to an open area.
There stood a collapsed, old house—made of straw and mud walls, the kind you never see in modern times.",,,,
19,"Inside the house, a human skeleton lay on the ground.",,,,
20,"(There’s no way a skeleton just ends up in a house under normal circumstances...
This feels like it was something sinister...)",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
21,"Hidden by grass, there was a faint path leading from the abandoned house into the forest.
Using a stick to push aside the overgrowth, Star Man followed it.
At the end, he found a small cemetery and a shrine.",,,,
22,(!! A person...!),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
