1,Status,About Status,"This game has ten stats: ""Body Stamina"",
""Mind Stamina"", ""Explosive Power""
""Hydration"", ""Body Fatigue / Injury""
""Carbohydrates"", ""Protein"", ""Fat""
""Vitamins"", ""Minerals""",○
2,Status,"About ""Body Stamina"" 1","Each stat has a Max value, a Recoverable
Max, and a Current value. Walking or
running lowers both the Recoverable Max
and the Current value.",○
3,Status,"About ""Body Stamina"" 2","Standing still, sitting, or lying down
restores the Current value but not the
Recoverable Max. Sleeping restores the
Recoverable Max in proportion to sleep
time.",○
4,Status,"About ""Body Stamina"" 3","If the Recoverable Max never falls below
70 % in a day, the Max value decreases
by 1 % due to lack of exercise.",○
5,Status,"About ""Mind Stamina"" 1","Represents focus and willpower. It
affects attack power and spellcasting.",○
6,Status,"About ""Mind Stamina"" 2","Gradually decreases just by staying
awake. Sleeping fully restores it; going
to bed late restores only 50 %. Talking
or casting spells also lowers it.",○
7,Status,"About ""Mind Stamina"" 3","Has Max, Recoverable Max, and Current
values. Lying down with 50 % or less
causes you to fall asleep even at noon;
sitting with 20 % or less does the same.",○
8,Status,"About ""Explosive Power""","Thickness of fast‐twitch muscle.
Influences damage dealt, damage taken,
and movement speed.",○
9,Status,"About ""Body Repair""","Represents injuries such as muscle
soreness, bruises, cuts, sprains, and
burns. A value of 100 means uninjured.
Decreases when you are attacked—or when
you attack. It also drops from various
actions. Recovers while sleeping, and
when it does, the Max values of Body
Stamina and Explosive Power increase.",○
10,Status,"About ""Hydration""","Top survival priority. Dropping even 1 %
makes Stamina and Mind Stamina drain
faster, worsening with every further 1 %
loss. Death occurs at 90 %.",○
11,Status,"About ""Carbohydrates""","Second only to water. When Carbohydrates
reach 95 % or more, you are full and
cannot eat further.",○
12,Status,"About ""Protein""",A shortage hinders recovery.,○
13,Status,"About ""Vitamins""",A shortage hinders recovery.,○
14,Status,"About ""Minerals""",A shortage hinders recovery.,○
15,Status,"About ""Sleep / Faint""","Occurs when Mind Stamina hits 0 or when
you lie down with low Mind Stamina. You
will move again after seven in‐game
hours—or 1.5 real hours. Being attacked
while asleep or unconscious is instant
death. You will not fall asleep while
swimming.",○
16,Status,"About ""Common Cold""","Heals in five days. Physical activity
makes it worse, as does mental exertion.",○
17,Status,"About ""Arm Fracture""","Attack power reduced by 90 %. Lowers
Body Stamina, Mind Stamina, and
Explosive Power. Debuff lessens over
time, but full recovery takes three
months. Healing stops if any nutrient
falls below half.",○
18,Status,"About ""Leg Fracture""","Movement speed reduced by 90 %. Lowers
Body Stamina, Mind Stamina, and
Explosive Power. Debuff eases over time,
but complete recovery takes three
months. Healing stops if any nutrient
falls below half.",○
19,Status,"About ""Headache""","Takes one day to heal. Drinking water
makes it worse.",○
20,Status,"About ""Stomachache""","Heals in one day. Eating or drinking
aggravates it.",○
21,Status,"About ""Dehydration""","Heals in one day. Recovery stops if
water or any nutrient is lacking.",○
22,Status,Condition,"Possible states: Arm Fracture, Leg
Fracture, Headache, Cold, Stomachache,

on the back, 3rd on the belly, 4th left
hand, 5th right hand.",○
