2,Star Man reached the coconut trees.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
3,(There are a few coconuts on the ground.),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
4,Coconuts were scattered across the ground from the typhoon.,,,,
5,(I didn’t realize coconut trees were this tall. It’d be hard to pick one from the tree.),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
6,Star Man looked up at the coconut tree.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
7,"(What's the difference between coconuts and palms...? I have no internet, so I can't look it up...
Damn... I can’t even grip properly...)",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,

10,"Star Man drank the coconut water. Just as the man had said, there was white edible flesh inside.",,,,
11,(I've seen the white part in a video before...),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
12,He could only carry two coconuts at a time.,,,,
13,(I need something—anything—that works like a bag. Carrying just two at a time is far too inefficient.),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,

15,"As Star Man returned to the coconut trees, he spotted a blue spherical object in the distance.",,res\\image\\sphere00.png,,
16,(That’s probably one of the cube monster’s allies... It’s huge... I’d better keep my distance.),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
17,"The spherical monster, like the cube one, was about a meter in diameter.
It didn’t look quite as massive, but it still seemed to weigh several hundred kilograms.",,res\\image\\sphere00.png,,
18,(How do you calculate the volume of a sphere with a 50 cm diameter again...? I forgot...),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
19,(I’ll grab two coconuts and head back to him.),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
