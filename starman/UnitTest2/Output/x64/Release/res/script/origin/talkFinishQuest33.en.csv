1,Star Man returned to the ruins.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
2,"""A-Are you okay...!?""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
3,Trapezoid Man panicked when he saw Star Man’s wounds.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
4,"""I don’t know... I might die in my sleep tonight.
But if that happens, I’ll come back to life.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
5,"""I-I see...""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
6,Triangle Man and Rectangle Man were speechless at the sight of Star Man’s wounds.,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
7,Star Man told Trapezoid Man and the others what had happened that day.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
8,"""Here’s the map.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
9,Star Man spread out the map for everyone to see.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
10,"""We’re probably around here.
The area with coconut trees was apparently called 'Sinkhat Coast.'""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
11,"""Do ships ever come to Prolitan Island?
When I looked into going to Optipl Island,
I don’t think I found any ships that stop at Prolitan.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
12,"""...""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
13,"""So I was thinking... why don’t we try building a boat to escape?""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
14,"""What?""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
15,"""I’ve got a one-year time limit, so that’s my only option.
As for the rest of you, maybe it’s better to stay and wait for help.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
16,"""That’s... a tough call.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
17,"""Yeah, it’s a pretty hard choice. More like an ultimate dilemma.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
18,"""I’ve never done it, but building a four-person boat has to be
way harder than making one just for a single person.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
19,"""No doubt about that.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
20,"""So I think the most realistic plan is for me to build a one-man boat,
head to the Zeefolk Republic, find another boat, and come back for you.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
21,"""Let’s go with that.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
22,"""Oh, and those red fruits we left soaking in the river—
I tried one, and it was fine.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
23,"""That’s great. That should help a lot with our food situation.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
24,That night—,,,,
25,Star Man couldn’t sleep because of the pain from his melting skin.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
26,(What should I do from here...? This is bad. I can’t move.),res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
27,"""Ugh... ngh...""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
28,"Gritting his teeth through the pain, Star Man slowly sat up.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
29,"""Hey... can you come here for a second...?""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
30,He called over the children who had been watching over him.,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
31,"""As you can see, I won’t be able to move for a while.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
32,"""It’s okay.""",res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
33,"""Yeah.""",res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
34,"""I think I’ll be able to walk in about three days.
Until then, I need you to gather food.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
35,"""We’re already doing that, so it’s fine.""",res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
36,"""Thank you.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
37,Three days later—,,,,
38,"Even after three days, Star Man still couldn’t walk properly.
Over the next month, he devoted himself to training in magic and crafting bows and arrows.
With both adults unable to move, their survival depended entirely on the two children.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
39,"Thanks to discovering how to detoxify the red fruits, they had just enough food to survive.",res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
40,"Star Man and Trapezoid Man worked together using sticks and vines
to make bows and arrows around the house.
Without knives, they could only use stones,
so the final product basically just looked like bent branches.
Still, it was better than throwing by hand and had some practical use.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
41,"The kids wanted some too, so they made four and everyone got one.
Before long, target practice became the latest craze.",res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,res\\image\\shikakuman00.png,,
42,"Star Man continued his magic training every day.
Eventually, he was able to summon a meter-tall spike of ice from the ground,
create falling icicles,
and summon a 30cm fireball.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
43,"Magic took a while to cast,
and even when it activated, it moved slowly.
Plus, it left him so drained he could barely stand.
He had to be careful when and how he used it.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
44,Star Man began incorporating ice rain and fireballs into daily life.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
45,"He had hoped ice magic might solve the water shortage,
but the ice it produced was more like an ""ice-like substance""—
it couldn’t actually be melted for water.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
46,Star Man decided to start gathering materials for the boat.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
47,"Even after a month, his burns hadn’t healed.
Whenever he moved, the wounds reopened,
and yellow fluid would leak out.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
48,"Fortunately, the acid hadn’t reached deep into his elbows and knees,
so he could still move his limbs with some effort.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
49,"Since dying would reset his body,
and he had a one-year deadline,
he had no choice but to push himself.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
50,"While gathering materials for the boat,
Star Man decided to visit the Ubuntu Cave that was marked on the map.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,,,
