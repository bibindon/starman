1,One month later.,,,,
2,A month had passed since they decided to build a boat.,,,,
3,"Star Man spent his days gathering food and materials for the boat,
while Trapezoid Man and the others focused on building it.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
4,Star Man’s fire magic wasn’t hot or stable enough to melt copper ore.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
5,"The four of them gathered in Trapezoid Man’s room.
In front of Trapezoid Man was a small boat, about 30 centimeters long.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
6,"""Star Man, I just can’t find a way to fill the gaps.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
7,"Trapezoid Man said to Star Man.
The boat was made from string and sticks and was full of gaps.
They had no nails, saws, or glue.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
8,The four of them had been trying to find a way to seal those gaps.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
9,"""So while I was working on this, I had an idea.
Instead of a boat, why don’t we make a raft?
We could just tie logs together with rope.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
10,Trapezoid Man pulled out a raft from behind him.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
11,"""Ta-da!""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
12,Triangle Man said.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
13,"The raft was about 30 centimeters long, made of sticks and rope.
The sticks were tied together into flat plates, stacked in alternating layers.
A bunch of nuts were tied to the ends for flotation.",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\sankakuman00.png,,
14,"""We don’t have a saw, but if we make an axe from stone,
we could probably cut trees up to 10 cm thick.
One layer would sink easily, so the plan is to stack multiple layers like this.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
15,"""Stacking them in alternating directions makes it more stable when someone stands on it.""",,,,
16,"""I see.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
17,"""Wow... I’m impressed...""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
18,Star Man was moved by Trapezoid Man’s work.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
19,"""This should hold together for at least ten days.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
20,"The opposite shore was 100 km away.
No one knew what a 100 km voyage would actually be like, but...",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
21,"Assuming it would take ten days to reach their destination,
Star Man and the others set a provisional goal: “It just has to hold together for ten days.”",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
22,"""Alright. Let’s switch to making a raft.""",res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
23,The four of them decided to start building a raft.,res\\image\\hoshiman00.png,res\\image\\daikeiman00.png,,
